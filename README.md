# Bootie

Problem Statement:
In rural India, a significant portion of the population faces challenges in accessing proper footwear, making it difficult for them to obtain shoes that fit their feet comfortably and adequately protect them from environmental hazards. The lack of accessible and affordable shoe options has led to several issues, including:

1. Foot Health and Hygiene: The absence of appropriate footwear exposes individuals to various foot-related health problems such as cuts, injuries, infections, and fungal diseases, which can significantly impact their overall well-being and productivity.

2. Safety and Comfort: Many rural individuals, especially those engaged in agriculture and manual labor, are required to work in harsh conditions, and without suitable shoes, they are prone to accidents and discomfort, leading to reduced productivity and livelihood challenges.

3. Education Hindrance: Children in rural areas often have to walk long distances to schools barefoot or with inadequate footwear, which hinders their educational pursuits and contributes to absenteeism due to health concerns.

4. Economic Opportunities: The lack of proper shoes can limit rural individuals' ability to access employment opportunities outside their villages, thereby restricting economic growth and perpetuating poverty in these regions.

5. Social Stigma: In some cases, the absence of proper footwear can lead to social stigma and exclusion, affecting individuals' confidence and self-esteem.

The problem requires a comprehensive approach that considers the affordability, accessibility, and suitability of footwear for the rural population, taking into account their specific needs and socio-economic circumstances. Finding sustainable solutions to address these issues will contribute to better foot health, improved safety, enhanced educational prospects, and overall economic and social development in rural India.
